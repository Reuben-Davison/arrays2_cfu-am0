# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel like more use would be beneficial, especially using other statements.  
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I felt that the struggle was getting a bit long but that at the end it was beneficial. I had to look up several things on Google and try to fix issues but now I've learned some important lessons.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to make a handy cheatsheet of common methods.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I would like to go over the syntax "#{}". Google!!! Or sometimes it helps when you explain it.
